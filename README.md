Hi, happy to see you here :)

The main part of this app is Searchable concern that implements multicolumn search logic for ActiveRecords.

To run this project please follow these steps:
1. Add ```.env``` file to the root of the repo and specify your DB credentials within that file.
2. Run this command:  
```rake db:{create,migrate,seed}```
3. Open root (```/```) or ```/programming_languages``` endpoint.

I hope you enjoy my code :)
